# Vercel Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Configuration Files

- [x] `vercel.json` - Created with proper routing and build settings
- [x] `vite.config.js` - Updated with build optimizations
- [x] `.vercelignore` - Created to exclude unnecessary files
- [x] `package.json` - Updated with deployment scripts

### 2. Build Test

- [x] `npm run build` - Successfully completed
- [x] `dist` folder created with all assets
- [x] No build errors or warnings (except chunk size warning which is normal)

### 3. Project Structure

- [x] All React components properly structured
- [x] Image assets correctly imported and accessible
- [x] Routing configured for SPA (Single Page Application)
- [x] All product category pages created and functional

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Push code to Git repository
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect Vite framework
6. Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Vercel CLI

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel
vercel --prod  # for production
```

## 📋 Build Configuration

### Vercel Settings:

- **Framework**: Vite
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

### Optimizations Applied:

- Code splitting for better performance
- Asset optimization and caching
- SPA routing support
- Manual chunk splitting for vendor libraries

## 🔧 Environment Variables (if needed)

If you need to add environment variables:

1. Go to Vercel project dashboard
2. Settings > Environment Variables
3. Add variables like API keys, database URLs, etc.

## 🌐 Custom Domain (optional)

1. Go to Vercel project dashboard
2. Settings > Domains
3. Add your custom domain
4. Configure DNS as instructed

## 📊 Performance Notes

- Build size: ~2.5MB total
- Largest chunks: Images (~1MB each)
- JavaScript bundles: Optimized with code splitting
- CSS: Minified and optimized

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Build fails**: Check dependencies in package.json
- **Routing issues**: Verify vercel.json rewrites
- **Asset loading**: Check image import paths
- **Performance**: Consider image optimization

## ✅ Ready for Deployment!

Your project is now fully configured for Vercel deployment. All necessary files are in place and the build process is working correctly.
